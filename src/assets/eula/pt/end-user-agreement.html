<h4>Goal of the Data Processing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Optimize the usage of the charging stations by the users while keeping the cost low.</li>
  <li>Improve the maintenance and the vehicle rotation on the charging stations.</li>
  <li>Develop a charging optimization algorithm to introduce a load management system that enables EVs to charge
    concurrently according site's constraints (site's maximum power...)
  </li>
  <li>Encourage users to charge at home in order to lower the infrastructure's load and eventually get their electricity consumptions reimbursed for charging their
    professional cars
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<ul>
    <li>This application has been designed considering all personal data privacy from the beginning.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Third Party Product Integrations</h4>
<ul>
  <li><b>SAP Analytics</b>: used to process and display complex statistics</li>
  <li><b>SAP Concur</b>: used to reimbursed the energy spent by the users at home</li>
  <li><b>Stripe</b>: used for the billing and the payment of the sessions</li>
  <li><b>Gireve / Hubject</b>: used to publish the charging stations to a roaming platform</li>
  <li><b>Google Firebase</b>: used to send remote push notifications to the user's mobile phones</li>
</ul>
<h4>Involved Users</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The users that make use of the charging stations on the monitored site and who registered to the
  <a href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-Mobility</a> application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Processing Target</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The data processing are for site managers, data scientists and demos to internal/external customers.</li>
  <li>Users access the data only through the secured protocol (HTTPs)
  </li>
  <li>SAP data scientists receive only the anonymized transactions from an admin to test their charging algorithms.</li>
  <li>For demoing the <a href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-Mobility</a> application to
    external people (not SAP), we use a demo user to anonymize all the personal data.
  </li>
  <li>User's sessions could be pushed to to SAP Analytics systems in Germany for testing or demo purposes.</li>
  <li>User's sessions could be processed to predict charging demand on a given site.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Data Localization</h4>
<ul>
    <li>The application will be deployed and the data will be stored on a Cloud platform that is located in Europe.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Right to Oblivion</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Your personal data will be kept until the end of your employment contract with the company.</li>
  <li>Your personal data will be erased manually after an inactivity period of 6 months (no connection to the application during that time.)</li>
  <li>Your personal data will be erased in case you request it (make an inquiry to the <a href="mailto:dpo@e-mobility-solution.com">Data Privacy Officer</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Security</h4>
<ul>
  <li>User and Password are required to access the application for all the users.</li>
  <li>The data is securely sent over the network using an encrypted protocol (HTTPs) thus ensuring the confidentiality.</li>
  <li>Only administrators are authorized to read, write, edit, delete all the data stored in the database.</li>
  <li>Standard users are only authorized to read and edit their own personal data, see the charging stations availability, the current charge,
  the history of their sessions and their statistics.</li>
  <li>Your data can be communicated to third parties in case of legal inquiry such as "Inspection du travail" or "Services fiscaux" or police services.</li>
</ul>
<h4>User Consent</h4>
<ul>
  <li>You must give your explicit consent for us to use your data.</li>
  <li>This is done via a checkbox in the login page of the <a href="{{chargeAngelsURL}}" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-Mobility</a> application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Right to access and correct data</h4>
<ul>
